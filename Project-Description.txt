This project's current intention is to boot a GUI through greasemonkey 
when activated for the current page being viewed. This visual overlay 
will cover the entirety of the page and present small sets of sigificant 
data such as all applicable cookies, headers, HTTP methods and status 
codes.

It will assort this (and more, as expounded upon) data and present it in 
a professional manner. This document must be printable for business use.
