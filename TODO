All code must be asynchronous and modular. No exceptions.

- Create an error handling engine
  + each "module" throws an error to the main engine

- Establish an appropriate GUI design

- Functions needed/ideas
  + parse url
  + parse cookies
  + get http headers
  + test all http methods on active page
    - return status codes for each method
  + log keys of designated form
